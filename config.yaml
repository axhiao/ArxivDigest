# For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
topic: "Computer Science"
# An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
categories: ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computational Geometry", "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "Information Retrieval", "Machine Learning", "Social and Information Networks"]

# A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant

# For example:
#     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"
#     "gas chromatography, mass spectrometry"
#     "making lots of money"
